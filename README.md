## Quick Start (Prototype)

### Prerequisites
- Neon PostgreSQL database connected (via v0 integration)

### Setup Steps

1. **Run the database migrations**:
   Execute the SQL scripts in order via the v0 interface:
   - `scripts/001-create-tables.sql`
   - `scripts/002-seed-data.sql`

2. **Start using the app**:
   The app works immediately with default settings. No environment variables needed for prototyping!

3. **Test accounts** (from seed data):
   - Worker: `john.doe@example.com` / `password123`
   - Client: `jane.smith@example.com` / `password123`

### Optional Configuration

For production deployment, you can set:
\`\`\`env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
\`\`\`

But these have sensible defaults for development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Neon PostgreSQL database (automatically configured via integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
\`\`\`bash
npm install

2. **Set up environment variables**:
The Neon integration automatically provides `DATABASE_URL`. You only need to add:
\`\`\`env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
\`\`\`

3. **Initialize the database**:
Run the SQL migration scripts in order:
\`\`\`bash
# These scripts are in the /scripts folder
# Run them via the v0 interface or your database client
001-create-tables.sql
002-seed-data.sql
\`\`\`

4. **Start the development server**:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`
